# Getting the Most Out of Dwellsmith + Claude

You've got Dwellsmith connected to Claude — nice! Here are some ways to make it part of your daily routine without it ever feeling like work.


## ☀️ Start your morning with a quick check-in

Try saying:

> "Good morning — what's my household look like?"

Claude will pull up your dashboard: overdue tasks, people you haven't reached out to in a while, upcoming maintenance, and anything else that needs attention. It's like a morning briefing for your home life.

Other ways to ask:
- "What's going on with the house this week?"
- "Any tasks overdue?"
- "What do I need to deal with today?"


## 📞 After a call or visit, just mention it

Whenever you talk to someone, tell Claude about it in plain language. It'll log it and keep track of when you last connected.

- "I called Mom"
- "Texted Sarah yesterday"
- "Had coffee with Jake on Saturday"
- "Video called Dad for about 45 minutes"
- "Emailed my landlord this morning"

You don't need to be precise. Claude understands words like "yesterday," "today," and days of the week.


## 🔧 When something breaks, capture it fast

Don't let it rattle around in your head — just tell Claude:

- "Add a task: fix the leaky faucet by Friday"
- "New task: call the electrician about the outlet in the kitchen"
- "Task: order new air filters"
- "Add a task: get quotes for fence repair"

You can include a due date or leave it open. Either way, it's captured.


## 📋 Do a weekly review

Once a week (Sunday evening works great), ask:

> "Who needs contact this week?"

Claude will show you anyone you haven't reached out to recently, based on the contact frequency you've set in Dwellsmith. It's a gentle nudge, not a guilt trip.

More things to ask during your weekly review:
- "What tasks are still pending?"
- "What maintenance is coming up?"
- "What's overdue?"


## 🤝 Keep track of your helpers

Whether it's a house cleaner, dog walker, babysitter, or handyman — log their visits and payments as they happen.

- "The dog walker came today"
- "Maria came Tuesday — pay her $150"
- "Paid the cleaners $200 by Venmo"
- "Log that the lawn service came on Monday"

This builds up a history so you never have to wonder "wait, did they come last week?" or "how much do I owe?"


## 🏠 Stay on top of home maintenance

Houses need regular attention. Ask Claude about it so nothing slips through the cracks:

- "What maintenance is due soon?"
- "Mark the furnace filter replacement done"
- "Is anything overdue on the house?"

When you complete something, just say so and Claude will log it — and if it's a recurring item, it'll set up the next due date automatically.


## 💡 Quick capture patterns that work

Here's a cheat sheet of natural phrases Claude understands well:

| What you say | What happens |
|---|---|
| "Called Mom" | Logs a phone call with Mom |
| "Texted John yesterday" | Logs a text, dated yesterday |
| "Completed laundry" | Marks the laundry task as done |
| "Maria came today" | Logs a visit from helper Maria |
| "Maria came Tuesday, pay her $150" | Logs the visit AND the payment |
| "Pay Maria $150" | Logs a payment for Maria |
| "Add task: fix leaky faucet" | Creates a new task |
| "Who haven't I talked to in a while?" | Shows overdue contacts |
| "What's on my plate today?" | Shows your current tasks |
| "What's my household look like?" | Full household dashboard |


## 🎯 The golden rule

If you can say it naturally, Claude can probably handle it. You don't need to learn special commands or remember exact phrases. Just talk about your household the way you'd tell a friend, and Dwellsmith will keep everything organized behind the scenes.

The best system is the one you actually use — and talking is a lot easier than typing into an app. 😊
